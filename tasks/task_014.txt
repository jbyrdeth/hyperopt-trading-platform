<info added on 2025-05-29T08:20:30.022Z>
Created comprehensive Prometheus alerting rules (19 rules across 2 groups) covering API performance, system resources, optimization jobs, export operations, business logic, health checks, and deadman switch monitoring. Configured Alertmanager with intelligent routing based on severity levels, alert inhibition rules, and secure webhook integration with Trading API. Implemented Alert Management API with webhook endpoints, alert processing, storage, statistics tracking, and RESTful endpoints for management. Created Grafana notification channel provisioning for email, Slack, Webhook, and PagerDuty with template-based formatting. Testing confirmed full alerting pipeline operational from Prometheus → Alertmanager → Trading API with centralized alert management, scalable webhook processing, and comprehensive alert lifecycle management.

## 5. Develop Health Check System [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive health checks for the API and related components
### Details:
Create health check endpoints that verify connectivity to dependencies, database status, queue system health, and overall API functionality. Implement deep health checks that test critical business functions. Configure Prometheus to monitor these health checks and trigger alerts on failures
<info added on 2025-05-29T08:28:02.384Z>
I'll be enhancing our health check system with a comprehensive implementation. The existing HealthChecker class in monitoring/health.py will be integrated with the health router in routers/health.py to provide a unified health monitoring solution. 

Key enhancements will include:
- Automated background health monitoring with configurable intervals
- Integration of health check results with our Prometheus metrics pipeline
- Implementation of deep business logic health checks for the optimization engine and data systems
- Health check triggers that connect directly to our alerting system
- Dependency health checks for all external services and integrations
- Comprehensive testing of failure scenarios to verify alert generation

This implementation will ensure we have real-time visibility into system health across all components and can proactively respond to issues before they impact users.
