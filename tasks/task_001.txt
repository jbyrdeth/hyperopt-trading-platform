# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, create the folder structure, and set up the required dependencies.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Set up the project structure as outlined in the PRD
3. Create a requirements.txt file with the following dependencies:
   - ccxt==4.0.0
   - pandas==1.5.0
   - numpy==1.24.0
   - hyperopt==0.2.7
   - ta==0.10.0
   - plotly==5.15.0
   - scikit-learn==1.3.0
   - scipy==1.10.0
   - pyyaml==6.0
4. Set up a virtual environment using venv
5. Install the dependencies using pip
6. Create a .gitignore file to exclude the virtual environment and other unnecessary files

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the project structure matches the PRD specification
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Check that the virtual environment is working properly
4. Verify that Git is initialized and .gitignore is set up correctly
