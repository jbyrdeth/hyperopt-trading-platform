# Subtasks:
## 1. Diagnose and Fix NoneType Errors in Batch Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze the current /api/v1/optimize/batch endpoint implementation to identify and resolve the root causes of NoneType errors, particularly in the batch service logic.
### Details:
Review logs and stack traces to pinpoint where NoneType errors occur, inspect object initialization and data flow, and implement fixes to ensure all required objects are properly instantiated and handled.
<info added on 2025-06-07T20:31:07.489Z>
Initial investigation findings:

The NoneType error in the batch optimization endpoint occurs when calling .get() on a None object. This happens during request processing when testing with strategies "MovingAverageCrossover" and "RSI" with a common configuration.

Key areas to examine:
- The batch optimization endpoint implementation in src/api/routers/optimization.py
- Optimization service batch processing logic
- Object initialization patterns where None values may be propagated
- Request parameter extraction and validation

The error specifically manifests with this request structure:
```
{
  "strategies": ["MovingAverageCrossover", "RSI"],  
  "common_config": {...},
  "parallel_jobs": 2
}
```

Need to implement proper null checks and object validation to prevent the NoneType error.

âœ… FIXED: NoneType Error Resolved!

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- Found the exact issue in src/api/services/optimization_service.py line 130
- The code was calling `request.strategy_specific_configs.get()` without checking if `strategy_specific_configs` was None
- The BatchOptimizationRequest model defines `strategy_specific_configs` as `Optional[Dict[str, OptimizationConfig]]` (can be None)

FIX APPLIED:
- Added proper null check before calling .get() method
- Changed from: `request.strategy_specific_configs.get(strategy_name, fallback)`
- To: `request.strategy_specific_configs.get(strategy_name, fallback) if request.strategy_specific_configs else fallback`

This ensures we safely handle the case where strategy_specific_configs is None and fall back to common_config.optimization_config.

READY FOR TESTING: The batch endpoint should now work without NoneType errors.

## 2. Resolve Strategy Serialization Issues with Hyperopt Parameters [done]
