# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Hyperparameter Optimization System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a hyperparameter optimization system using Hyperopt TPE algorithm with multi-objective optimization capabilities.
# Details:
1. Integrate Hyperopt library for TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) algorithm
2. Implement multi-objective optimization for return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown
3. Create a custom objective function that combines multiple performance metrics
4. Implement parallel processing for optimization using multiprocessing
5. Add early stopping criteria to halt unpromising optimizations
6. Implement result caching to avoid re-running identical optimizations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for optimization functions
2. Integration tests with sample strategies
3. Performance tests to ensure efficient use of computational resources
4. Verify consistency of results across multiple runs
