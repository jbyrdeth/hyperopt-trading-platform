# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Multi-Exchange Data Fetcher
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a data fetching module that can retrieve historical OHLCV data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges with intelligent caching and data validation.
# Details:
1. Use CCXT library to implement data fetching from KuCoin, Binance, and Coinbase Pro
2. Implement intelligent caching mechanism using SQLite or similar lightweight database
3. Create data validation functions to check for gaps, outliers, and inconsistencies
4. Implement fallback logic to use alternative exchanges if primary source fails
5. Support multiple timeframes: 1H, 4H, 1D
6. Implement rate limiting to avoid hitting API limits
7. Use asyncio for concurrent data fetching to improve performance

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each exchange integration
2. Integration tests for data fetching, caching, and validation
3. Performance tests to ensure efficient data retrieval
4. Edge case tests for handling API errors and rate limits
