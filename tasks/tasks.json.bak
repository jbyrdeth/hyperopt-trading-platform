In `_execute_signal()` method:\n   - When opening positions, `strategy.open_position()` updates the strategy position\n   - `current_capital` is reduced by commission + slippage ONLY\n   - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: The actual trade value (money spent buying the asset) is NOT deducted from current_capital\n\n2. In portfolio value calculation (lines 342-345):\n   ```python\n   total_value = self.current_capital + position_value\n   ```\n   This creates double-counting where:\n   - `current_capital` still contains money that should have been spent on trades\n   - `position_value` reflects the current market value of the position\n   - Same money is counted twice, artificially inflating returns\n\nThis explains why we see 0 trades but high returns:\n- No trades recorded because only `_execute_exit()` creates Trade objects\n- Positions are being opened but not properly reflected in capital\n- Double-counting makes portfolio value grow artificially as asset prices increase\n\nFix required: Properly deduct trade value from current_capital when opening positions.\n</info added on 2025-05-29T17:55:25.604Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-29T17:57:37.631Z>\n**CRITICAL BUG FIXED SUCCESSFULLY!**\n\n**Fix Implementation Complete:**\n\n**What was fixed:**\n- **Root Cause**: Double-counting in portfolio value calculation in `src/strategies/backtesting_engine.py`\n- **Location**: Lines 420-425 in `_execute_signal()` method\n- **Problem**: When opening positions, only commission + slippage were deducted from capital, not the actual trade value\n- **Result**: Portfolio value calculation double-counted the same money (once in capital, once in position value)\n\n**Fix Applied:**\n```python\n# BEFORE (buggy code):\nself.current_capital -= (commission + slippage)\n\n# AFTER (fixed code):\nself.current_capital -= total_cost  # Includes trade_value + commission + slippage\n```\n\n**Additional improvements:**\n- Enhanced logging to show trade value, commission, slippage, and remaining capital\n- This ensures proper capital accounting and eliminates the double-counting bug\n\n**Expected Results After Fix:**\n- Trades will now be properly recorded (no more 0 trades)\n- Returns will be realistic and based on actual trade performance\n- Portfolio value calculation will be accurate\n- The \"4520% return with 0 trades\" bug is eliminated\n\n**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Bug identified, root cause found, fix implemented\n**Next Step**: Test the fix with API once rate limit resets, then proceed to subtask 16.2\n</info added on 2025-05-29T17:57:37.631Z>",

The portfolio value calculation includes massive swings because position values are being calculated incorrectly during the main backtest loop.\n\n**BREAKTHROUGH EVIDENCE:**\n✅ All 5 breakthrough configurations now working (vs 0 before)\n✅ Trade generation successful (31-75 trades per config)  \n✅ High win rates (54-80%)\n✅ Positive Sharpe ratios (0.06-3.51)\n✅ Reasonable individual trade returns (1.28%)\n\n**REMAINING ISSUE:**\nPosition value calculation causing astronomical annualized returns due to portfolio value swings during active positions.

Review and update all strategy implementations (from Tasks 5 and 7) that might be affected by this change, ensuring they use the compatible random number generation methods.\n\n6. Modify the batch optimization endpoint (from Task 19) to utilize the fixed random number generation, enabling real optimization calculations.\n\n7. Implement a version check for NumPy in the project's initialization to warn users if an incompatible version is detected.\n\n8. Add error handling to gracefully manage any remaining compatibility issues, logging detailed information for debugging.\n\n9. Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes in random number generation usage across the project.",
      "testStrategy": "1. Create a comprehensive test suite that covers all modified components:\n   - Unit tests for individual functions using the updated random number generation methods\n   - Integration tests for the optimization system\n   - End-to-end tests for the batch optimization process\n\n2. Implement tests with different NumPy versions (e.g., 1.16.x, 1.20.x, 1.24.x) to ensure cross-version compatibility.\n\n3. Verify that all strategies can now run real optimization calculations:\n   - Execute batch optimization for all 24 strategies\n   - Compare results with previous mock data to ensure significant differences\n   - Check optimization logs for any fallback to mock results\n\n4. Perform a full system test:\n   - Run a complete backtest using the optimized strategies\n   - Verify that performance metrics are calculated correctly\n   - Ensure no errors related to random number generation occur\n\n5. Stress test the batch optimization endpoint:\n   - Send multiple concurrent optimization requests\n   - Verify that all requests complete successfully with real results\n   - Monitor system resources to ensure efficient processing\n\n6. Conduct code review to ensure all changes adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.\n\n7. Update and run all existing automated tests, ensuring no regressions in other parts of the system.\n\n8. Perform manual testing of the API endpoints related to strategy optimization and execution.\n\n9. Document any changes in behavior or performance as a result of this fix for user reference.",
